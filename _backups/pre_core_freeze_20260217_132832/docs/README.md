# Docs Overview

The `docs/` folder is the continuity and design-control surface for DDNA.

## Mini Directory
- `ARCHITECTURE_EVALUATION.md` — full-system evaluation and roadmap.
- `CODEX_UPGRADE_LOG.md` — chronological codex continuity log.
- `RECURSIVE_FEEDBACK_SYSTEM.md` — recursive improvement operating model.
- `codex/` — runbook/prompt/contracts for codex execution.
- `feedback/` — packets, bundles, and iteration documents.
- `ledger/docs_ledger.jsonl` — documentation continuity ledger.

## Sequence of Events
1. Evaluation identifies gaps and priorities.
2. Feedback packets/iterations capture applied changes.
3. Upgrade log and docs ledger record continuity across sessions.

## Interlinking Notes
- Root `README.md` points here for governance and iteration context.
- Engineering changes should map back to documented findings/iterations.
