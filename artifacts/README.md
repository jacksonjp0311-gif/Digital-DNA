# Artifacts Mini-README

This folder stores runtime outputs generated by `engine.orchestrator.run_ddna`.

## Key files
- `last_run.json` — canonical execution artifact consumed by tests.

## Notes
- Artifacts are generated files and may change on every run.
- Do not hand-edit `last_run.json`; regenerate by running the orchestrator.
