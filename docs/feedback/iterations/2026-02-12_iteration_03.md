# Iteration Report: 2026-02-12 / Hardening + Recursive Feedback Enablement

## 1) Trigger / Objective
- User requested deeper repo analysis, concrete issue fixes, and a recursive feedback system integrated into `docs/` for better Codex iteration coherence.

## 2) Findings (Before)
- Weight config parsing accepted missing/unknown keys and unbounded values.
- Baseline initialization policy was implicit and could silently mutate state in CI.
- Ledger timestamp ownership conflicted between orchestrator and append layer.
- No explicit operating model in docs for recursive Codex upgrade loops.

## 3) Changes Applied
- Code changes:
  - Added strict runtime validators for weights and output records.
  - Added baseline lock mode (`DDNA_BASELINE_LOCK`) for genome and drift baseline initialization behavior.
  - Unified timestamp ownership at orchestrator level and removed overwrite in ledger append.
  - Added hardening test script validating new constraints.
- Documentation changes:
  - Added docs hub README and recursive feedback operating document.
  - Added reusable iteration template and current iteration report.
  - Rewrote architecture evaluation to align with current state and next evolutions.

## 4) Validation Commands
- `python -m engine.orchestrator.run_ddna`
- `python tests/behavioral_test_v1.py`
- `python tests/structural_envelope_test_v1.py`
- `python tests/hardening_test_v2.py`

## 5) Results
- All validation commands passed.
- Hardening checks validated weight constraints, record invariant contract, and baseline lock behavior.

## 6) Risks / Remaining Gaps
- Theory-level constructs (`H7`, integration class ladder) still need first-class runtime fields.
- Stub drift channels remain inactive.
- CI automation for these new checks is not yet configured.

## 7) Next Actions
1. Implement schema versioning and policy outcomes in artifacts.
2. Add CI workflow for hardening + invariant tests.
3. Add integration class computation into runtime record.
4. Expand drift channel set with feature flags.
