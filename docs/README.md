# Documentation Hub

This folder is the control plane for DDNA design continuity, evaluation, and recursive Codex-guided iteration.

## Mini Directory
- `ARCHITECTURE_EVALUATION.md` — current full-system technical evaluation and roadmap.
- `CODEX_UPGRADE_LOG.md` — chronological continuity log for each Codex upgrade/session.
- `RECURSIVE_FEEDBACK_SYSTEM.md` — operating model for iterative, evidence-driven improvement loops.
- `feedback/` — templates and iteration artifacts used to run recursive improvement cycles.

## Interlinking
- Root `README.md` links to the evaluation and continuity artifacts.
- Each Codex session should update `CODEX_UPGRADE_LOG.md` and add an iteration record under `feedback/iterations/`.
- Engineering changes should map to findings in `ARCHITECTURE_EVALUATION.md`.
