# Theory Overview

The `theory/` folder contains formal DDNA model documents.

## Mini Directory
- `digital_dna_software_theory_v1_3.tex` — locked evolution and structural law basis.
- `codex_digital_dna_theory_memory_architecture_v1_6.tex` — codex memory architecture formalization.

## Sequence of Events
1. Theory establishes formal invariants.
2. Engine/docs encode those invariants in executable form.
3. Evaluation/tests verify implementation against theory constraints.

## Interlinking Notes
- Theory should align with `engine/` invariants and docs continuity narratives.
- Update docs/tests when theory-level assumptions are revised.
