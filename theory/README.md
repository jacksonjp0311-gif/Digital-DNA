# Digital DNA Theory

This folder contains the canonical theory documents for DDNA formalization.

## Mini Directory
- `digital_dna_software_theory_v1_3.tex` — **DDNA v1.3 · Locked Evolution** formal software theory with extraction framework, fragment equivalence operator, drift inevitability theorem, and replication verification conditions.
- `codex_digital_dna_theory_memory_architecture_v1_6.tex` — **DDNA v1.6 · Locked** structural replication memory architecture formalization with recursive stability field and cross-context persistence framing.

## How It Works
- These are reference theory artifacts, not runtime engine code.
- They define the conceptual and mathematical basis that the implementation can map to measurable invariants and drift/stability outputs.

## Interlinking
- Referenced by the root `README.md` in the new **Theory** section.
- Used as source material for architectural evolution and roadmap decisions in `docs/ARCHITECTURE_EVALUATION.md`.
