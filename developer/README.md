# Developer Mini-README

This directory contains internal analysis utilities, reports, temporary scripts, and backups.

## Highlights
- `module_*.py/json` — module health and drift analysis outputs.
- `README_*.md` — per-module explainers generated for onboarding.
- `snapshots/`, `backup/`, `tmp/` — diagnostics and historical recovery material.

Most files here are support artifacts and not part of runtime execution.
