# Mutations Archive Overview

The `_mutations/` folder stores mutation artifacts and baseline snapshots generated by automation.

## Mini Directory
- `baseline_*` entries — captured mutation baselines by timestamp.

## Sequence of Events
1. Mutation workflow emits baseline snapshots.
2. Snapshots are preserved for rollback/comparison.

## Interlinking Notes
- Archive-oriented; not a primary source directory.
- Keep timestamped naming deterministic for traceability.
